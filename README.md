# Background

This Git repository offers a Quarto template for writing bachelorâ€™s, diploma, and dissertation theses. Originally adapted from a LaTeX template by [Eli Holmes](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/quarto-thesis), this version has been customized to meet the specific requirements of Johannes Kepler University (JKU).
